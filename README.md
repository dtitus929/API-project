# AirBnB Clone

AirCnC is a full stack clone project built while attending App Academy coding bootcamp.  It involved coding a back-end utilizing an Express server framework with a Sequelize ORM. The front-end was built using React and makes use of Redux as a data store.  No styling frameworks were used... just standard CSS.

This project was a great first step in learning how to put together a fully functional RESTful back-end API and connecting it to a clean, responsive and intuitive front-end.

## Setup Instructions

The structure for this app includes a root package.json for remotely deploying the application as a Node.js server.  The backend and frontend folders contain package.json files for setting up both the back-end and front-end servers.

#### Launching the Full Application Locally

1. Download the application as a zip file from GitHub.
2. From within the backend folder install the dependent npm packages: `npm install`
3. Migrate the Sequelize database schema: `npx dotenv sequelize db:migrate`
4. Generate Sequelize seed data for testing: `npx dotenv sequelize db:seed:all`
5. Start the back-end server: `npm start`
